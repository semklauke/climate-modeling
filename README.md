## Julia Code
Julia Code can be found in `milestone1/` up to `milestone7/`

### Installation
To install the Julia depedencys just run 
```bash
$ make install
```
and follow the instructions if you are usign MacOS.

For PyPlot to work, **python2** or **python3** should be installed.
See [PyPlot Doc](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyPlot.jl#installation) for more informations

### Running
To run the main file for the milestone run
```bash
$ make run
```
If you want to speed up the plotting try
```bash
$ make runp
```
This generates a (precompiled sysimage)[https://julialang.github.io/PackageCompiler.jl/dev/index.html] of the included Julia libraries 

## Python Code
*IF* there is python code (doing the same thing) it is in the `python/` folder.

But Python is the inferior programming language.
